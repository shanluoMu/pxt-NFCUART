## Summary
NFC Sensor expansion board provides some Micro:bit blocks for reading and interpreting PN532 NFC RFID Module over I2C.
These blocks make it easy to operate or acquiring imformation from the card via NFC sensors.Near field communication(NFC) 
is a set of standards for smart phones and similar devices to establish radio communicationwith each other by touching 
them together or bringing them into close proximity, usually no more than a few centimeter.
